	<p id="p1">I began playing percussion in sixth grade band. I played all through school and one year I was the only percussionist in our high school band. I also had a couple bands out of my parents and other friends garages.</p>
    
    <h3 id="two">Music Major</h3>

    <p id="p2">When I got to BYU-Idaho I spent four semesters as a Percussion Performance major and learned a lot from my peers and great facaulty. I also entertained the idea of being a music education major, but throught this time struggled to keep up with the demands of learning rudimental snare drum, timpani, marimba, and keep up on my drum set playing.</p> 
    
    <h3 id="three">Now</h3>

    <p id="p3">The time I spent as a music major taught me that I may not want or be able to make playing music my career right now, but I gained a deeper love and appreciation for music as an art form. I have also been set on a journey of lifelong growth and development in music. I also believe that the lessons I learned apply to other areas of life and hope I will be able to connect my love of music with my budding software skills.</p>
